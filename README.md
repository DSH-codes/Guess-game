Guess_game

# Description:

A simple guessing game called "Which Hand?" was created during several days of training with a new UI module named Kivy.
It turned out to be not as easy to comprehend as Tkinter, with everything nested into each otherâ€”layouts, buttons, 
entries, etc. However, the module is very powerful and tangible, and with the help of AI's explanations, a lot of 
amazing simple and complex apps can be created with it. My attempts to package it for Android via Buildozer, despite
all the efforts, were unsuccessful. Maybe you, my friend, will handle it.

My game has a simple UI and logic, consisting of 70 to 100 lines of code. Just start it and play. Guess in which hand 
the diamond is. If you are correct, you get +1 score; if you are wrong, you get +1 miss. Click the counters to reset 
them. Set auto-restart to make it close its hands, or click restart manually.
 
# Usage:

Important: Make sure that you have Kivy 2.1.0 module installed, or the game won't work.
If the pictures of the hands, the diamond, do not render into UI, please open the script
and make all paths to the pictures - absolute!
